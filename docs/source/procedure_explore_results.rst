Explore Results
===============
:func:`threadcount.procedures.explore_results.run`
This procedure operates on threadcount output files. It will display a figure with a map
on the left where you can click on a pixel or move arround with keyboard arrows and it will
display an emission line with its corresponding fit from threadcount on the right figure
It assumes you already run ex3.py script, but you can run it with any threadcount output file.
